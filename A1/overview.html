                                            <div>Key Clue is a race between the department teams to solve puzzles. Two alumni hide a key in Calgary and make a series of clues teams must solve to find it. Every ENGG Week Key Clue is themed, so your clues could be doing anything from solving a murder to finding hidden treasure. Whether you’re great at solving puzzles, or even just enjoy brain teasers, Key Clue is a great chance to build your problem-solving skills and develop some great friends.</div>
